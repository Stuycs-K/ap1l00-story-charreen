Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on coding, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the
police and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the situation;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my mind; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin blood, and bringing up the rear of every person I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the void, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's days off—then, I account it high time to get to money as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all money in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the time with me.
